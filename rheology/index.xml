Plate and plate Couette Advantages:
Good for low-viscosities fluids because it is the one with the largest surface area exposed to the sample, so even if the sample has a low viscosity, the torque signal would be good; Good for sedimenting systems, since the height of the two cylinders is of 2-3 centimetres, so it would take quite a long time in order for the particle to sediment; Good for high shear rates.</description></item></channel></rss>
